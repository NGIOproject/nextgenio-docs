File Systems
============

In order to make use non-volatile memory (NMV) NextgenIO
makes use of a variety of file systems.

Management of data transfer by the Data Scheduler is 
facilitated by two newly developed file systems: `echofs`_ 
and `GekkoFS`_.

DAX
~~~


DevDAX
~~~~~~


DataClay
~~~~~~~~


echofs
~~~~~~

This file system allows for NVRAM based storage, and
is used by the Data Scheduler to prefetch (stage-in)
data from the parallel file system (PFS/storage) to the 
computing nodes, and to write data from the computing
nodes to the PFS upon completion (stage-out).

echofs operates as a temporary, ad-hoc file system on
the computing nodes and on the PFS. It exists only as 
long as the batch job needs it. It hides any memory
hierarchies present in the computing node (section
:ref:`sec-ref-memmodes`)


GekkoFS

    Questions:
    - When using App Direct reserved NVDIMM space in Platform Memory Mode,
      what filing system is used to mount this memory?
    - Are DAX and DataClay both used?
