OSPRay
======

OSPRay is Intel's Open Source Portable Ray tracing engine,
applied in data visualisation and (interactive) rendering.
The engine relies strongly on the `Intel Embree 
<https://www.embree.org/>`_ kernels. Documentation can be 
found on the `OSPRay wbsite 
<https://www.ospray.org/documentation.html>`_ and on the 
`OSPRay GitHub <https://github.com/ospray/OSPRay>`_.
