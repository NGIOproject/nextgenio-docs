OpenFOAM
========

OpenFOAM is a numerical solver for computational fluid dynamics,
therefore focussing on solving linear systems of differential
equations. Documentation can be found on the `OpenFOAM website
<https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/>`_.

OpenFOAM can be combined with GekkoFS to run the Motorbike 
tutorial, which comes included with the standard OpenFOAM 
installation.
